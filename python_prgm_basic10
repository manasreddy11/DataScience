nthlargest(3)
3th largest number is 464
7. Write a Python program to print even numbers in a list?

6.Answer:
even = []
for i in L:
    if i%2==0:
        even.append(i)
print(even)
[2, 4, 10, 464, 48486]
8. Write a Python program to print odd numbers in a List?
	
8.Answer:	
odd = []
for i in L:

9. Write a Python program to Remove empty List from List?
9.Answer:
l = [[],123,2,3,[1,2,3],[]]
for i in l:
    if i==[]:
        l.remove(i)
print(l)
[123, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
10. Write a Python program to Cloning or Copying a list?
10.Answer:
def cloning(l):
    copy = []
    for i in l:
        copy.append(i)
    print("original list : {}\nCloned List: {}".format(l,copy))

cloning(l)
original list : [123, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
Cloned List: [123, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
