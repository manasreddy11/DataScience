5. What are the six comparison operators?
> greater than
>= greater than or equal to
< less than
<= less than or equal to
= is equal to
<> is not equal to

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.
6. Answer: Equal to implying two values are equal to one another i.e a = 5, b= 5, a==b which is an equality sign, assignment operator(=) assigns a values to the variable like a = 5, implying the variable “a” = 5

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

7. Answer: Block 1:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')

block2: 
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
block3:
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

print(“Howdy”)
else:
print(“Greetings!”)

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ctrl+Z

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break: it eliminates the execution of the remaining iteration of loop 
Continue: It will terminate only the current iteration of the loop 

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Range(10): prints range(0,10) and contain numbers from 1 to 10 
Range(0,10): has number from 0,10 excluding 10 
Range (0,10,1) : numbers from 0,10 excluding 10 ad skipping 1 number 

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
12. Answer: 
i = 0
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
while loop:
i= 1
while(i<=10):
    print(i)
    i= i+1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
