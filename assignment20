1. Set the variable test1 to the string 'This is a test of the emergency text system,' and save test1 to a file named test.txt.
1. 
test1 = 'This is a test of the emergency text system,' filee = open('test.txt','w') filee.write(test1)

2. Read the contents of the file test.txt into the variable test2. Is there a difference between test 1 and test 2?
2. Answer: file2 = open('test.txt','r')
test2 = file2.readline()
test2

3. Create a CSV file called books.csv by using these lines:
title,author,year
The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,Alan Garner,1960
Perdido Street Station,China Miéville,2000
Thud!,Terry Pratchett,2005
The Spellman Files,Lisa Lutz,2007
Small Gods,Terry Pratchett,1992
3. Answer: 
import csv
rows =[ ['title','author','year'],
    ['The Weirdstone of Brisingamen','Alan Garner',1960],
    ['Perdido Street Station','China Miéville',2000],
    ['Thud!','Terry Pratchett',2005],
    ['The Spellman Files','Lisa Lutz',2007],
    ['Small Gods','Terry Pratchett',1992]]
with open('books.csv','w',newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(rows)

4. Use the sqlite3 module to create a SQLite database called books.db, and a table called books with these fields: title (text), author (text), and year (integer).
4. Answer: import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
c = conn.cursor()

c.execute('create table books(title varchar(20),author varchar(20), year int)')
conn.commit()

5. Read books.csv and insert its data into the book table.
5. Answer: 
import pandas as pd read_books = pd.read_csv('books.csv',encoding='unicode_escape') read_books.to_sql('books', conn, if_exists='append', index = False)
6. Select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order.
6. Answer: c.execute('select title from books order by title asc')
print(c.fetchall())

7. From the book table, select and print all columns in the order of publication.
7. Answer: 
c.execute('select title, author,year from books order by year') df = pd.DataFrame(c.fetchall(), columns=['title','author','year']) df
8. Use the sqlalchemy module to connect to the sqlite3 database books.db that you just made in exercise 6.
8. Answer: import sqlalchemy
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine("sqlite:///books.db")
rows = engine.execute('select * from books')
for i in rows:
    print(i)

9. Install the Redis server and the Python redis library (pip install redis) on your computer. Create a Redis hash called test with the fields count (1) and name ('Fester Bestertester'). Print all the fields for test.
9. Answer: 
import redis conn = redis.Redis() conn.delete('test') conn.hmset('test', {'count': 1, 'name': 'Fester Bestertester'}) conn.hgetall('test')
10. Increment the count field of test and print it.
10. Answer: 
conn.hincrby('test','count', 3)
