1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if guess_me is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal to 7.
1. Answer: def guess(guess_me):
    if guess_me<7:
        return 'too low'
    elif guess_me>7:
        return 'too high'
    elif guess_me==7:
        return'just right'

2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and exit the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.
2. Answer: guess_me = 7
start = 1

while True:
    if start<guess_me:
        print("too low")
    elif start==guess_me:
        print("found it")
        break
    else:
        print("oops")
        break
    start+=1

3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.
3. Answer: list = [3,2,1,0]
for i in list:
    print(i)

4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10)
4. Answer: 
[i for i in range(10) if i%2==0]
5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.
5. Answer: {i:i**2 for i in range(10)}

6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).
6. Answer: {s for s in range(10) if s%2!=0}
 
7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string 'Got ' and a number for the numbers in range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.
7. Answer: gen = ("Got"+" "+str(i) for i in range(10))
for j in gen:
    print(j)

8. Define a function called good that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'].
8. def good():
    return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']

9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned.
9. Answer: def get__odds():
    odds = []
    for i in range(10):
        if i%2==1:
            odds.append(i)
    return odds[2]

10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write the code to catch this exception and print 'Caught an oops'.
10. class OopsException(Exception):
    pass

def caught(a):
    if a<0:
        raise OopsException(a)
        

try:
    caught(-1)
except Exception as e:
    print('Caught an oops')

11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate'] and plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop'].
11. Answer: titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']
plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']

movies = dict(zip(titles,plots))
print(movies)
