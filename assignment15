1.How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).
1. Answer:  60 *60
2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour.
2. Answer: seconds_per_hour = 3600
3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour and minutes per hour.
3. Answer: minutes_per_hour = 60
Seconds_per_hour*24
4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day
4. Answer: seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour*24
5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.
5. Answer: seconds_per_Day/ seconds_per_hour
6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?
6. Answer: seconds_per_Day// seconds_per_hour
7. Write a generator, genPrimes, that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to its next() method: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
7. Answer: def getPrimes():
    prime = []
    n = 2
    while True:
        
        for i in prime:
            if n%i==0:
                break
        else:
            prime.append(n)
            yield n
        n=n+1
generator = getPrimes()
