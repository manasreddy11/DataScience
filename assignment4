2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
2. Answer: spam[2] = “hello”
Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
3. Answer: d

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
4. answer: “d”
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?

5. Answer: “a”, “b”, “c”
Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
6. answer: 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
7. Answer: [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
8. answer: [3.14, 'cat,' 11, True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
15. Answer: Adding ‘[]’ around the tuple can convert the the tuples into a list and vice vera for tuples value list form 
Ex . [(2,3), (4,5)]  &  ([2,3], [5,4])

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
16. Answer: Just values assigned in the list 

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
17.Answer: if the change made in the list after it is deep-copyed, didn’t affect the original list it is said to be deep copyed. 
If you make a change in the copyied version, and it makes a change in the original list then kt is said to just be copyed.
